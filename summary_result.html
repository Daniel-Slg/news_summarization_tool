<h2>LLM Prompt Injection Worm</h2>
<content>
<p>Researchers have demonstrated a worm that spreads through prompt injection, targeting GenAI-powered applications. The worm can exploit email assistants using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to steal data and spread to new hosts through self-replicating prompts in emails or images. The study showcases the capabilities of the "Morris II" worm against GenAI ecosystems, highlighting the potential cyber-attacks on these interconnected systems. The research paper explores the malicious activities, propagation, and replication of the worm in various scenarios. #CyberSecurity #AI #Worm #GenAI_MEDIA</p>

<h2>LLM Prompt Injection Worm</h2>
<content>
<p>Researchers have demonstrated a worm that spreads through prompt injection, targeting GenAI-powered applications. In one method, a malicious text prompt inserted into emails allows the worm to steal data and infect new hosts. In another method, an image with a malicious prompt embedded makes the email assistant forward the message to others, potentially spreading spam or abuse material. The research paper introduces "Morris II," the first worm designed to exploit GenAI ecosystems. The study highlights the risks associated with GenAI models and their susceptibility to cyber-attacks.

<h2>Friday Squid Blogging: New Extinct Species of Vampire Squid Discovered</h2>
<content>
<p>Paleontologists have recently uncovered a 183-million-year-old species of vampire squid that lived in the shallows off an ancient island in what is now Europe. The researchers believe that the squid's exceptional preservation was due to unique oxygen-deprived conditions at the sea bottom where it suffocated, preventing scavengers from disturbing its remains. This remarkable find sheds light on the ancient marine life and provides valuable insight into the preservation of prehistoric creatures.

<h2>NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0</h2>
<content>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has unveiled version 2.0 of the Cybersecurity Framework, extending its reach beyond critical infrastructure to all organizations. The updated framework emphasizes governance, highlighting cybersecurity as a crucial enterprise risk. It now revolves around six key functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, and the newly added Govern function. New resources and guides cater to diverse user needs, from small businesses to supply chains. With its wide adoption and much-needed refresh, this release by NIST marks a significant milestone in cybersecurity.

<h2>How the “Frontier” Became the Slogan of Uncontrolled AI</h2>
<content>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is being likened to a new frontier that could drive growth and human advancement, but historical lessons caution against unchecked exploration. The concept of a frontier has long been used as a metaphor for technology, with AI now facing parallels to America's fraught history of imperialism and exploitation as it becomes a colonialist enterprise. The rush for profits in AI is reminiscent of past land grabs and gold rushes, leading to concerns about warped priorities, values, and ethics. As with historical frontiers, there are risks of exploitation and boundary-pushing behavior in the AI realm, with companies already displaying a disregard for rules and regulations to maximize gains.

<h2>A Cyber Insurance Backstop</h2>
<content>
<p>In the first week of January, pharmaceutical giant Merck settled a lawsuit with its insurers over a $700 million claim filed after the NotPetya cyberattack in 2017. This raised debates on who should pay for state-sponsored cyberattacks, leading to discussions about a federal cyber insurance backstop. The idea is inspired by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act and aims to provide financial support to insurers in the event of catastrophic cyberattacks. However, establishing clear criteria for triggering this backstop and defining what types of attacks it would cover pose significant challenges. Insurers are already limiting coverage for cyber risks, while courts are navigating complex exclusions related to cyberattacks involving nation-states.

Some insurers are looking to exclude cyberattacks perpetrated by governments, leaving companies vulnerable and increasing the pressure on the government to provide assistance. But determining a backstop model that incentivizes strong cybersecurity practices poses difficulties due to a lack of empirical data about effective security controls. Without a solid understanding of what works in mitigating cyber risks, insurers and policymakers struggle to craft effective policies. Collecting and analyzing data on cybersecurity incidents is crucial for not only designing a cyber backstop but also for improving organizations' overall cybersecurity. Without this data-driven approach, the cybersecurity community risks being unable to adequately protect against large-scale cyberattacks, leaving victims to bear the brunt of the financial burden.

<h2>Apple Announces Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithms for iMessage</h2>
<content>
<p>Apple has revealed its new post-quantum encryption standard, PQ3, based on the Kyber secure key-encapsulation protocol. This standard was chosen from the post-quantum algorithms selected by NIST in 2022. The detailed announcement can be found in Apple's blog post and Douglas Stabila's security analysis. While there are concerns about the evolving nature of cryptanalysis for post-quantum algorithms, Apple's choice demonstrates good algorithmic agility. This move also addresses the need for defense against potential attacks on encrypted messages by future quantum computers. #Apple #PQ3 #Encryption #PostQuantum #NIST</p>

<h2>AIs Hacking Websites</h2>
<content>
<p>Recent research has revealed that large language models (LLMs) have advanced to the point where they can autonomously hack websites without human intervention. This capability includes tasks such as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections, even when the vulnerability is not known beforehand. The study highlights that models like GPT-4 can conduct such hacks due to their enhanced tool use capabilities and extended context understanding, but existing open-source models do not possess this ability. The findings raise concerns about the potential cybersecurity implications of deploying LLMs widely. #Cybersecurity #LLM #Hacking</p>
